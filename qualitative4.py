# Question1 : 4980
# Question2 : The skewness is highly positive with a value of 87.47. This means the distribution is right skewed and we can clearly see hit on the histogram. The mass of the distribution is concentrated on the left.
# Question3 : No
# Question4 : The cumulated work experience of the founders. I would assume that the higher this number, the higher the project would be solid and have a chance to be funded.
